# Concrete-Mold
A Mold for a Bird-House made of Wood-Concrete.
There a many different recipes for Wood-Concrete on the Internet.

Groundplate (Bottom) to hold the outer mold while the concrete is hardened

I need at least two Steel Mold 
1. inner mold (one piece, pipe one side closed /welded  )
2. outer mold (from two Half-Pipes , mounted with screw thru side flange)
3. Different types of mould for the Bird Hole (e.g. small bird , big bird)

Additional Fixtures to hold the inner mold with Distance from the Bottom and in the Middle of the outer mold
